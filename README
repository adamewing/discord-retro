discord-retro is a tool to identify transpoable element (TE) insertions from
paired-end whole-genome sequence data, specifically tuned for Illumina reads.

There are a number of auxilliary files that specify details of the various
TEs one expects to find. Currently, discord-retro is configured to analyse
human genomes; this can be changed by substituting the appropriate annotations
for another species of interest.

More details to come, but for now, users can try running discord-retro on the
example .bam included (test/example.bam) with the following commandline:

./discord-retro.py -s samplelist_example.txt -c human.cfg -o test/output

output will end up in test/output/example, the most relevant files are
other.tab.txt and otherbreaks.tab.txt, the former contains the coordinates and
annotations, the latter contains breakpoint information.
